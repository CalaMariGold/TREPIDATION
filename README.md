TREPIDATION is a roguelite horror progression-based modpack built heavily around a timer and vertically stacked dimensions.

You spawn in the Nether and immediately notice there is a timer on the bottom of your screen ticking down. Your goal is to get to the top of the world and slay the Ender Dragon before the timer runs out. Each dimension is vertically stacked on top of each other and are unique with their own barriers, progression, mobs, challenges, etc. Movement has been greatly expanded upon, allowing you to sprint faster, dodge mid-air multiple times, double jump, and wall climb right off the bat. You will also have a wide variety of unique weapons and tools at your disposal that you will find from mob drops and chests as you progress.
