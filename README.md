TREPIDATION is a roguelite horror progression-based 1.16.5 modpack based heavily around Immersive Portals and stacked dimensions.

The player spawns in the Nether and immediately notices there is a timer on the bottom of their screen ticking down. Their goal is to build up to the top of the world and slay the Ender Dragon before the timer runs out. Each dimension would be unique with their own barrier, progression, mobs, challenges, etc. Each dimension also has their own timer. The time can be extended by acquiring a specific item which you will occasionally get during your progression.
