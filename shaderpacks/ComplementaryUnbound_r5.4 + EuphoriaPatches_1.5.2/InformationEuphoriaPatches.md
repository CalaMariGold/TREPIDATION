# What is Euphoria Patches?
Euphoria Patches is an add-on for Complementary Shaders, developed by SpacEagle17. It aims to extend Complementary with more optional handcrafted features and settings.  

**Please don't report any issues encountered using this add-on to EminGT.**

# License notice:
Most of the code in this project is subject to the Complementary License Agreement by EminGT (check License file) and is therefore NOT allowed to be redistributed.

# Why does Euphoria Patches need a mod?
[Complementary's license](https://github.com/ComplementaryDevelopment/ComplementaryReimagined/blob/main/License.txt) does not allow me to publish Euphoria Patches directly as it does not have a "noticeably differen[ce] from the Original Pack in multiple common gameplay scenarios that must include daytime overworld visuals, regardless of the setting or variable changes in the Modified Pack and/or the Original Pack". I simply add onto Complementary, this would not qualify as an viable edit. A mutual agreement with Emin was made to distribute Euphoria Patches through a patcher where none of Emin's code gets distributed (and by that not breaking the license) and the user has to have Complementary Shaders installed in order to get the add-on. All parties profit from this method.

# When does Euphoria Patches update?
Euphoria Patches Updates Immediately after a new Complementary Version is out. This includes dev versions. Euphoria Patches dev versions are available on **[Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/spaceagle17)** or **[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/SpacEagle17)**!

# Euphoria Mod Support
Check the supportedMods.md file or the [properties repo](https://github.com/EuphoriaPatches/propertiesFiles)

- Euphoria Patches aims to better support modded blocks than regular Complementary by having default modded block support (check block.properties). Light Source Detection with automatic applied emission. Foliage model detection with automatically applied SSS.
- Euphoria Patches adds support to MANY blocks, entities and items though the properties files thanks to the community. Check the supportedMods.md file or the [properties repo](https://github.com/EuphoriaPatches/propertiesFiles)
- Better modded end handling, the ender beams and fog will correctly change to the intended fog color in non vanilla biomes in the end


# Best Shader Loader
Euphoria Patches and also Complementary Shaders use iris-exclusive features which don't work on optifine. For the optimal experience, Iris is recommended on Fabric and Neoforge. On Forge Oculus is for now recommended as it seems to support most iris-exclusive features.
