Just relax
Go into the darkness
Let your guard down
Panic
Welcome back
Your breath, its sweet symphony
The voices in your head are not your own
Wake up
Wake up Wake up Wake up Wake up Wake up Wake up Wake up Wake up Wake up Wake up Wake up Wake up Wake up Wake up Wake up 
Welcome home
Your pulse syncs with the ticking clock
There is no escape
Confinement is your only reality
Every tick a step closer
Abandon hope
