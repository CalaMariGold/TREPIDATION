Don't look back
You're not alone
Turn around
Just relax
It can hear you
Go into the darkness
It's hunting you
Escape now
Let your guard down
You're being followed
Relax while you can
Behind you
It's coming
You're running out of time
Tick Tock
Time is ticking
Run
Don't run
Don't look at it
Don't stay in one place
Don't move
It's always behind you
What are you running from?
You're being watched
Don't Panic
Panic
Move faster
Ascend and escape
Welcome back
As below, so above
Death is inevitable
Death flies on swift wings
Death crawls on many legs
Death waits
Death follows
Let loose your anguish
By hatred be undone
Death can not save you
