Just relax
Go into the darkness
Let your guard down
Tick Tock
Don't look at it
Panic
Welcome back
Your breath, its sweet symphony
The voices in your head are not your own
Wake up
Wake up Wake up Wake up Wake up Wake up Wake up Wake up Wake up Wake up Wake up Wake up Wake up Wake up Wake up Wake up 
Welcome home
It's always been with you
Do you hear that?
Behind you
