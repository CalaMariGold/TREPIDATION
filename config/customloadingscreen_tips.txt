Don't look back
You're not alone
Turn around
Just relax
It can hear you
Go into the darkness
It's hunting you
Escape now
Let your guard down
You're being followed
You will die. A lot
Smile while you can
Don't ever stop
It's coming
You're running out of time
Tick Tock
Time is ticking
Hurry
Run
Don't stay in one place
You're in danger
It's always behind you
