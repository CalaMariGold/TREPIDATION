    # Allows you to increase the render bounding boxes of entities (or all entities of a mod). Width increases the size on the X and Z axis. Top increases the size in the positive Y direction. Bottom increases the size in the negative Y direction. (Accepts 'modid=width,top,bottom' or 'modid:entity=width,top,bottom').
