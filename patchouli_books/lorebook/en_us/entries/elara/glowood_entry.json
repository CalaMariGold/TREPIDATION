I vaguely remember the Nether brimming with life, a rich landscape of diverse flora. The Glowood Trees were among the many vibrant plants that thrived here. Now, these trees—as well as mushrooms dotted across the landscape—seem to be the last remnants of that once lush ecosystem."

These small beings dwell within the leaves, their soft glow providing a mesmerizing light. The Gloworms not only thrive within the protective canopy of the Glowood Trees but also played a crucial role in the ecosystem. Fortunately, they are edible as well."
