To activate it is to become time's creditor and debtor simultaneously - the initial anchor point blooms like a wound in reality's fabric, every subsequent moment accruing interest paid in fractured resurrection. The ritual leaves metallic aftertastes: copper from the usurpation's hunger, ash from the soul-bond's pyre."

The twin components resonate with dangerous synergy. Soul's anchor craves permanence while chrono's grasp devours continuity. Their union births temporal eddies that erode the Veil's already-tenuous fabric."

My experiments suggest brief anchorings in loci of temporal fragility - where Veilstrium veins surface or Infernal cores still smolder. The resonance lingers longest when set amidst paradox: a death avoided through usurpation's theft, a sanctuary forged from stolen breaths."
