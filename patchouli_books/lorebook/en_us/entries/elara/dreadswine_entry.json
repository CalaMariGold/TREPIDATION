Driven by a single purpose, they scour these depths for the fabled Dreadstone Tablet, an ancient relic from before their fall, which promises the return of their lost souls and a passage back to the moment of their undoing. Yet, for these lost souls, they have only come across fragments; cruel teases of the oblivion they crave."
