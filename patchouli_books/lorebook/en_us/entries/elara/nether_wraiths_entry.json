I recall their ancestral forms - ephemeral as smoke rings from a dead god's pipe. What alchemy of despair forged these new horrors? Their explosive demise rings too familiar, a dark mirror to our own catastrophic reinvention. Do we share the same blacksmith, hammering failure into fresh damnation?"

These calcified remnants thrum with the Nether's base frequency, their marrow-rich hollows conducting harmonies that make Veilstrium shiver in recognition. Each fragment I gather resonates with the ache of unclosed gateways, their song growing fainter as the wraiths themselves fade into myth's hungry maw."
