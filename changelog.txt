§a§lKnown Issues§r§r
- Rarely, Erebus structures will spawn high up and replace the barrier
- Creating a 2nd world or rejoining the same world in the same game session will cause a crash. Use the “Reset Run” button to avoid needing to create new worlds.
Multiplayer Only:
- Players joining in multiplayer sessions do not spawn at the same place (reset run to fix this). Players also sometimes permanently spawn in different locations on each reset
